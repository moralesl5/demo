# Introduction to Attributes & Selectors Lesson Plan

## Background Knowledge
- Boilerplate

- Basic CSS(in-line), how to link stylesheet

## Learning Objectives
- Selectors (2 Minutes)
- Classes (2 Minutes)
- IDs (1 Minute)
- Psuedo Selectors (If time permits)
- Code along (5 Minutes)

## Selectors
Selectors let us change how our website looks by applying styling (CSS) to different HTML *elements*. (Ask class about elements). 
- Use white board to demonstrate how to use a seletor with a body element, with an h1 element.

## Classes
Classes let us give these HTML elements names so that we can reference them in our styling. We can give multiple elements the same name, and style them all at once. 
- Use white board to demonstrate assigning a class to an element and how to reference it. ("iron-man-heading" on h1)

## IDs
IDs are like classes, but they are usually assigned to only one element. Have more power than classes!
- Use white board to demonstrate assigning an ID to an element and how to reference it. ('iron-mans-wife' on li in a list)

## Psuedo Selectors
Psuedo selectors are AWESOME. They describe what an element will look like when a user interacts with it.
- Use whiteboard to demonstrate :hover on a li
